# Stock Market Analysis with Python and SQL

This project involves analyzing historical stock market data using Python and SQL. The analysis covers various aspects, including calculating average prices, percentage changes, high-low peak-to-peak (PTP) values, and more. The analysis is performed on a sample dataset of stock market data.

## Setup

To run this analysis, you'll need the following dependencies installed:

- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- SQLAlchemy

You can install these dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas sqlalchemy
```

## Analysis Steps

1. **Import Dependencies:** Import the necessary libraries and set the Matplotlib style for visualization.

2. **Database Setup:** Establish a connection to the SQLite database containing the stock market data. Reflect the database tables and columns using SQLAlchemy ORM.

3. **Analyze Average Prices:** Query the average prices (open, high, low, close) for all stocks in the month of May. Visualize the results using a bar chart.

4. **Calculate Percentage Change:** Calculate the percentage change in prices from the open to the close of each stock. Visualize the results using a bar chart.

5. **Top Performers Analysis:** Identify the top performing stocks based on the percentage change. Visualize the top performers using a bar plot.

6. **High-Low PTP Analysis:** Calculate and visualize the high-low peak-to-peak (PTP) values for a selected stock (e.g., IBM) after a specific date.

7. **American Airlines (AA) Analysis:** Analyze the average prices and high-low PTP values for the 'AA' stock in the month of May. Visualize the average prices and PTP values using line plots.

8. **Additional Analysis and Visualization:** Apply additional analysis techniques, such as calculating daily returns, cumulative returns, volatility, rolling correlation, and a moving average trading strategy. Visualize the results using appropriate plots.

**Conclusion**

This analysis demonstrates how to use Python and SQL to perform various types of analysis on historical stock market data. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for investors, traders, and analysts. By applying similar techniques to other market indices like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, or specific company stocks, one can gain insights into market trends, stock performance, and potential trading strategies. The ability to visualize and analyze data using Python and SQL provides a powerful toolkit for making informed decisions in the dynamic world of financial markets.
